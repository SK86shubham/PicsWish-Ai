🚀 Developed an AI-based image enhancement web app using React.js + Tailwind CSS, enabling users to upload, preview, and download enhanced images — improving image clarity by up to 4x resolution via PicWish API.

📦 Designed a drag-and-drop upload system with 95%+ file-type validation accuracy, supporting up to 15MB images and 10+ formats (JPG, PNG, TIFF, etc.).

⏱️ Achieved <2s initial image preview time and optimized API polling for task completion within <30s using async polling logic.

🔽 Implemented a one-click download button allowing users to export enhanced images with 100% resolution retention and proper file-type handling.

🖌️ Crafted a responsive, modern UI with 6+ custom Tailwind color tokens, achieving a consistent and clean UX across desktop and mobile.
🔐 Secured API interactions using X-API-KEY headers and built error handlers for common responses like 401 (unauthorized) and 404 (resource not found).

🌐 Deployed the app on Vercel with environment-based configs for secure API key management and optimized production build (<300kb JS bundle).
